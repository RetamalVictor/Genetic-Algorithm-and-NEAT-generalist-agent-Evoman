# Genetic Algorithm and NEAT generalist agent-Evoman

This project was submited for the course "Evolutionary Computing" @ VU Amsterdam on October 2021

The project contains two trained by evolutionary algorithms to beat the game **Evoman**
The algorithms are :
- Genetic Algorithm
- Neuro Evoulution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT)
